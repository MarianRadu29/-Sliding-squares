    A winning strategy game "Sliding/Sliding Squares Game", which we present to you next, can be an interesting programming problem for any student. On a 5Ã—5 board, blue and red pieces are placed alternately ("checkered"), leaving the square in the middle of the board unoccupied.
The two players move, alternatively, orthogonally, one of their own pieces adjacent to the free space, into the free space.
The player who can no longer move loses (so the free space is surrounded only by the opponent's pieces, possibly also by the edge of the board).


    To be able to run the program you will have to use the graphics.h library, which is not pre-installed, so you will have to download it.
